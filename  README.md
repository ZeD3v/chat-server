# Pre-reqs

To build and run this app locally you will need the following:

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

# Getting started

- Clone the repository

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/jurgisrudaks/chat-server.git <project_name>
```

- Install dependencies

```
cd <project_name>
npm install
```

- Build and run the project

```
npm run build
npm start
```

Or, if you're using VS Code, you can use `cmd + shift + b` to run the default build task (which is mapped to `npm run build`), and then you can use the command palette (`cmd + shift + p`) and select `Tasks: Run Task` > `npm: start` to run `npm start` for you.

# Project Structure

The full folder structure of this app is explained below:

## Running the build

| Npm Script   | Description                                                                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `watch-node` | Runs node with nodemon so the process restarts if it crashes. Used in the main watch task |
| `watch`      | Runs all watch tasks (TypeScript, Node).                                                  |

| `dev-watch`  | The same as `watch` but includes the --inspect flag so you can attach a debugger          |

# Testing

This project, uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as test framework.

## Running tests

Simply run `npm run test`.
Note this will also generate a coverage report.

# ESLint

ESLint is a code linter which mainly helps catch quickly minor code quality and style issues.

## Running ESLint

Like the rest of our build steps, we use npm scripts to invoke ESLint.
To run ESLint you can call the main build script or just the ESLint task.

```
npm run build   // runs full build including ESLint
npm run lint    // runs only ESLint
```

# Dependencies

Dependencies are managed through `package.json`.
In that file you'll find two sections:

## `dependencies`
